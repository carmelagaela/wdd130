            <p>Hello! My name is Carmela Gaela, and I am from the Philippines. I enjoy binge-watching movies and series.
                I also love spending time with family and friends. I am the oldest of five children.
                I returned home from my full-time mission in October 2021 from the Philippines San Pablo Mission.
                Since returning home, I tried my best to get a job to support my education.
                Here I am, on that first step to becoming someone I am dreaming to be.
                I aspire to be a successful web developer who can provide for my family‚Äôs and my needs.
                In addition to this, I hope to give back for my parents‚Äô sacrifice to raise me.</p>
